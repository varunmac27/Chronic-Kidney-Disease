# Screening for Chronic Kidney Disease

To evaluate the increase in chances of Chronic Kidney Disease occurrence by comparing the change in underlying Key Performing Indicators. Odds ratio is computed to cater to the scope.
- Imputed derived variables, created new variables with interaction effect on and applied SMOTE on a dataset with 34 predictors
- Performed feature selection using Technology Assessment Model and validated interaction effectsâ€™ variables from Random Forest
- Using odds ratio in logistic regression, interpreted the likelihood probability of increase in the disease with a recall of 94.5%
- Applied random forest model to study the interaction effect and derived decision rules to classify patients.
